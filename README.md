# DataSync
A quick and dirty data sync executable, useful for transferring data from a computer/server to a smb/ftp

## How to Use

Configure the dataxfer.conf file with your connection details.
Run the application.

## Why?

I needed a small program that can run on a scheduled task that was more reliable than a powershell or bash script.
I previously had issues with some powershell scripts not firing properly, this was the solution.
QUick and easy and to the point.
